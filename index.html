    <!-- The little description of why clean water matters -->
    <p id="intro">
      Millions of people <strong>lack access to clean water</strong>, and even more people <strong>lack access to safe drinking water</strong> due to climate change, pollution, and overuse. <strong>Everyone deserves clean water</strong> and by working together with organizations and governments, this can be made possible.
